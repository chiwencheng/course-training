# Session 1

## 1. Introduction to ML

### Practical Reasons for Mastering ML
1. Reduce time programming (using off-the-shelf ml tool)
2. Customize and scale products (targeting to specific area and collecting data for same model)
3. Complete seemingly "unprogrammable" tasks (training with samples)

### More Info
- Change the way to think problems, using statistic not logic.

## 2. Framing

### Terminology
- Labels: variables we're predicting
- Features: input variables describing our data
- Models: maps examples to predict labels
